I'm a co-founder and CEO of a Seattle-based startup [Kaskada](https://kaskada.com/). We are hiring!

Previously, I served as the chair of the [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) Project Management Committee and software engineer in Google Cloud since its early days and the inception of [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow).
