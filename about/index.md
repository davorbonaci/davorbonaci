I'm serving as a chair of the [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) Project Management Committee, and have been regularly committing code to the project since its inception. I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer at Google.

Before Beam, I have been working on its predecessor, [Google Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow), since its beginnings, most recently by leading the development of the Dataflow SDK for Java.
